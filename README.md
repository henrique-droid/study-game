# 🙇‍♂️ About

<p>This is an application intended for student focus and planning, but in a fun way!. How many times have you thought of a way to organize your studies and focus on what really matters just to stop using it and ditching it away? Study Game is all about gamifying your student life and making it fun to plan for that next university project.

# 👾 Features

<p> The students will be able to view their course information and schedule, add events (like projects and tests), write notes on a board, and follow their grades. There will be a gamified user profile with HP, Mana, and Progress bars. The events created by the user will be attached to a quest/mission and will fail if not completed in time, resulting in a loss of progress. The user can earn coins to buy items or customize their appearance.
